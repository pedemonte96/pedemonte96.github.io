                            The project was a colaboration between the Bosch i Gimpera Foundation and the Department
                            of Electronics and Biomedical Engineering of the Universitat de Barcelona, supervised 
                            by Dr. Manel López. We developed a software that used machine learning techniques, such as
                            classifiers and regressors, to predict the most effective treatment to maximize the chances
                            of a patient having a positive fetal heart rate after in vitro fertilization. The software was
                            primarily programmed in Python.

                            Universitat de Barcelona, under the supervision of Dr. José Maria Gómez. The setup was based 
                            on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0205172.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> by 
                            D. Dehlinger and M. W. Mitchell, that aimed to violate the CHSH Bell inequality as the

                            We designed and built the coincidence electronic circuit, programmed a microcontroller 
                            to count coincident photons and aligned the optical elements to produce and 
                            detect the polarization of the photons.

                            the Universitat de Barcelona and was supervised by Dr. Manel López. We grew Indium Tin 
                            Oxide (ITO) on a silicon substrate via electron beam evaporation (EBE) and studied the 
                            properties of the nanowires formed. We analyzed the structures created in different 
                            initial conditions (changing the atmospheric composition of the chamber, the temperature 
                            and the time of exposition). The understanding of the properties of these structures 
                            is relevant to the construction of biomedical sensors.
